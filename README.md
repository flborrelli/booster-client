# Booster Ecoleta 

As part of the Next Level Week taught by [**Diego Fernandes**](https://github.com/diego3gsingle-page), we built a single-page Web application developed with TypeScript, Node.js and React :computer:.  

The main idea is to connect waste disposal points with anyone who produce recycling waste.
